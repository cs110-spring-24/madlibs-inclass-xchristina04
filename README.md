# Madlibs

## Brief

We will write a simple mad-libs program together in class today. After we work through it, you will add more to it yourself, creating your version of this program.

## Task

- Ask the user to input a noun.
- Ask the user to input an adjective.
- Ask the user to input a verb.
- Once all the inputs have been taken, print out a story using the inputted information. This story should make use of all the variables taken.

## Your turn

Now that we've done the first task together, it's your turn to add to this. I want you to add 10 more inputs and update your story to use those inputs.
